## Issues and Future Work

### GUI bugs

In the current version, there is some issue if you click when AI is computing. 

### Forbidden Move Version

The current data structure could support the forbidden move. I will do it in the near future. 

### Search Engine Efficiency

Other works could be improving the search engine efficiency.
